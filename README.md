# Overview: Who is Arcana 

[Arcana](https://arcana.network/) offers a decentralized, blockchain-based alternative to online file storage services.  Arcana may be viewed as a blockchain based analog to Dropbox, Google Drive, Microsofts' OneDrive and similair services. 

Arcana's mission is to build and enduser friendly privacy and storage layer for Ethereum and EVM compatible blockchains (e.g., Ethereum, Plogygon, and Binance).

Instead of an "us-against-them" approach, Arcana leverages the simplicity of centralized services provider's login mechanisms through OAUTH, while generating Ethereum Virtual Machine based, public-private keypairs behind the scenes.
 
Arcana was founded in May 2019 by Abhishek Chaudhary, Aravindh Kumar, Mayur Relekar.

## About This Working Demo: Arcana's Blockchain-based File Storage Demo Application

This application deploys Arcana's SDK demo app. It abtracts away the complexity of wrestling with public-private key pairs by allowing non-technical end-users to authenticate and use the app by means of common OAUTH user profiles.  OAUTH intergtion includes Google, Discord, Twitch, and others!

Specifically, this app demonstrates the following functionalities and use-cases addresed by Arcana:

* Identity and Access Management
* Decentralised Storage
* End-to-End Encryption
* Non-custodial Key Management

This demo runs on node 16.3+. To deploy and test, do the following:

1. Clone:
`git clone git@github.com:codesport/arcana-demo-2022.git`

2. Install:
